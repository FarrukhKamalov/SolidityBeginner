## Smart Contracts

Here are some of the smart contracts included in this repository:

- **EventExample.sol**: Demonstrates how to use events in Solidity.
- **HotelRoom.sol**: A simple hotel room booking contract.
- **Inheritance.sol**: Shows how inheritance works in Solidity.
- **Interaction-Exercise-Game.sol**: A game contract demonstrating interaction.
- **Todo.sol**: A simple to-do list contract.
- **PausableToken.sol**: Example of a pausable token contract.
- **Twitter.sol**: A contract for interacting with a Twitter-like application.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KamolovFarrux2005/SolidityBeginner.git
2. **Change directory**
   ```bash
   cd SolidityBeginner
3. **Open the desired Solidity file in your code editor.**

#  Usage 
You can compile and deploy the smart contracts using Remix IDE or any other Ethereum development environment. Make sure to have the required setup for Solidity development.

## Example Usage
To interact with any of the smart contracts, you can use the following steps in Remix:

1. Open the contract file (e.g., Todo.sol).
2. Compile the contract.
3. Deploy it to your desired Ethereum network (e.g., Ganache or testnet).
4. Interact with the contract functions in the Remix interface.
